xPland is a feature modeled after Microsoft Word’s AutoCorrect. It lets you create unlimited shortcut codes that expand into full words or phrases you type frequently. Its capabilities work not only in text editors but also in edit fields within web browsers.

## How to use

xPand includes a sample code **“hw”** for users to test and understand how the system works.

When typing a document or entering text in a web browser’s edit field, suppose you want to insert the phrase **“Hello World.”**

Press **CTRL+F3 (single tap)** to open the xPand AutoCorrect Dialog.

In the edit field, type the shortcut code **“hw”**, then press **Enter** — the dialog will close automatically, and **“Hello World”** will be pasted instantly into your document.

For first-time setup, users need to create and store their own shortcut codes.

Press **CTRL+F3 (double tap)** to open the xPand Settings window.

In the Code List, all shortcut codes and their full words are stored. You can press a code on the keyboard to jump to it directly.

Right-click within the list to add, edit, or delete existing codes.

* **To add a new entry:** Enter your shortcut code in the Code field and the full word or phrase in the Word field, then click **Add**. You’ll hear the announcement **“Add succeeded.”**
* **To edit an existing entry:** Select a code from the Code List, right-click or press the **Edit** button, make your changes in the Code or Word field, then click **Add** again. You’ll hear the announcement **“Edit succeeded.”**
